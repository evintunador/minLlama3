# minLlama3

This repo is meant as a guide on how Llama3's architecture works in the same vein of [Andrej Karpathy's minGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) (hint: it's basically the same as Llama2). Over in [the colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10BKvPomnVVZw7UAT3wOaaPBdvfMEvOOY?usp=sharing) I'll hold your hand through every single operation performed in Llama 3, and in 'model.py' you can check out what that code looks like once it's turned into actual pytorch `nn.Module` objects. 'training.ipynb' and 'inference.ipynb' are what they sound like. there are 3 different models and 4 different tokenizers over in 'models/' and 'tokenizers/'. The only requirement you'll need to install in order for everything to run that doesn't come with python by default is pytorch. Check out the accompanying youtube video!
